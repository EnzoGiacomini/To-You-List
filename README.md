# Simple To-Do List Project

This is a to-do list app I built to practice Vanilla JavaScript. It uses Bootstrap for basic styling and `localStorage` to save all the tasks.

## Features

* **Add & Delete Tasks:** You can add new tasks with a name, due date, and priority.
* **Saves to localStorage:** Everything is saved in your browser, so your tasks don't disappear when you refresh.
* **Automatic Status:** Tasks are automatically marked as 'late' if the due date passes.
* **Status Tracking:** Tasks can be 'on-going', 'done', or 'late'.
* **Filtering:** You can filter the list to see all tasks, or only the 'done' or 'late' ones.

## How to Run

There's no build process. Just clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

Still need to get the search bar working.

```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd [project-folder]
# (Just open index.html)
